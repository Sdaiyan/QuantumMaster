[h1]Mandate of Heaven[/h1]

The Taihu has mastered the Mandate of Heaven, capable of controlling various probability events in the game to achieve maximum benefits. This can greatly reduce the need for save-loading.

This MOD only does what can be done in the vanilla game. As long as the vanilla probability > 0.

For example:
In the wilderness, the vanilla game can only gather up to 3-quality primers, not 2-quality.
Combat ratings require certain positive actions to obtain combat reading/Zhoutian opportunities. Please check the wiki for details.
