### **Mandate of Heaven** - Mod Description **(Please use on the Test Branch)**

The Taiwu has unlocked the Arcane Secrets of Providence, gaining the ability to manipulate the probabilities of in-game events to secure the most favorable outcomes, drastically reducing the need for save-scumming (SL).

This mod does not enable anything impossible in the vanilla game. It only enhances what is already possible, provided the original probability is greater than 0%.

**For Example, it does NOT allow:**
1.  Obtaining a 2nd-grade Catalyst directly from wild foraging. This is impossible in the vanilla game. 【直接在野地通过采集获得2品的引子】
2.  A cricket with mismatched parts to become 'Vibrant'. This is impossible per vanilla logic. 【部位不符合的蛐蛐神采非凡】
3.  Triggering Combat Zhou Tian/Reading with entirely negative combat evaluations. This is impossible due to core game mechanics (refer to the wiki). 【在战斗评价全部都是负面评价的情况下触发战斗周天/读书】
