# Mandate of Heaven

The Taihu has mastered the Mandate of Heaven, capable of controlling various probability events in the game to achieve maximum benefits. This can greatly reduce the need for save-loading.

This MOD only does what can be done in the vanilla game. As long as the vanilla probability > 0.

For example:
In the wilderness, the vanilla game can only gather up to 3-quality primers, not 2-quality.
Combat ratings require certain positive actions to obtain combat reading/Zhoutian opportunities. Please check the wiki for details.
