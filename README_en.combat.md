### Martial Arts Realm Levels (Probability Settings)
- **Utterly Confused**: Mind completely out of control, techniques in disarray, full of vulnerabilities - the most dangerous predicament for a martial artist. (Combat random events are extremely unfavorable)
- **Anxious and Hesitant**: Mind unsettled, doubts abound, hesitant when striking, unable to perform at usual standards. (Combat random events are quite unfavorable)
- **Calm and Composed**: Heart settled, breath long and steady, undisturbed, able to reflect and respond to all things naturally. (Disable MOD features, default game experience)
- **At Ease**: Mind clear, demeanor composed, finding opportunities even at the edge of a blade, grasping the rhythm of battle. (Combat random events are relatively favorable)
- **As One Wishes**: Where the heart goes, the body follows, techniques without fixed form yet perfectly matching every opportunity - reaching the realm of a first-rate master. (Combat random events are very favorable)
- **Divinely Inspired**: Spirit clear as a mirror, as if heaven-sent, often finding life where impossible, unleashing power beyond one's limits. (Combat random events are extremely favorable)
- **Unity of Heaven and Man**: Spirit united with heaven, body merged with the Dao, all things in the world become allies, every change follows one's heart. (Combat random events are almost always favorable)
- **All Methods Return to One**: Exhausting all martial arts in the world, finally comprehending their source as one. This heart is the Dao, this thought is the principle, the battle's outcome predetermined before it begins. (Combat random events always reach theoretical maximum)

### Feature Switches
Each feature supports independent realm settings:
- **Follow Global**: Use global combat martial arts realm
- **Independent Setting**: Set martial arts realm specifically for this feature

## Notes
- This MOD focuses on combat features and can coexist with QuantumMaster
- CombatMaster uses **"Martial Arts Realm"** terminology (Utterly Confused, Anxious and Hesitant, Calm and Composed, etc.)
- QuantumMaster uses **"Luck"** terminology (Misfortune, Bad Luck, Smooth Sailing, etc.)
- The underlying calculation mechanism is exactly the same, only the names and descriptions differ
- Some features require specific game conditions to trigger
- Adjust martial arts realm levels according to personal preferences
